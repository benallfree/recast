== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a podcast? = 

A podcast is the modern equivalent of a radio program. You create audio recordings (episodes) of your show and publish them in various podcasting directories such as iTunes.

= What are podcasters and episodes? =

A podcaster is someone who produces a podcast. An episode is a single production or recording.

= What is a podcast directory? =

A podcast directory is a web site or listing where people can find available podcasts.

= What is a podcast network? =

A podcat network is a group of podcasters who combine efforts for mutual benefit. Typically, podcasts within a "network" will cross-promote each other to their listening audiences. This creates a rising tide effect and all podcasters and listeners benefit.

= How do people listen to podcasts? = 

Most often, people listen using software called a *podcatcher*. Podcatcher apps are available on desktop and tablets, but most often people have podcatcher apps installed on their mobile devices. Listeners use the podcatcher to subscribe to podcasts, and the podcatcher periodically monitors the podcasts for new episodes. New episodes are automatically downloaded so they are available when the listener wants them.

= What is a podcast feed or feed URL? =

When you publish a podcast, you do so by making your podcast information (show name, author, etc) and episode information (episode title, publish date, etc) available in a data format called a "feed". Typically the feed format is RSS. WordPress is very good at producing RSS feeds already, but podcasting has some special requirements that WordPress does not address out of the box.

Listeners subscribe to a podcast by inputting a feed URL into their podcatcher.

= What is Recast? =

Recast is a plugin for WordPress to create your own podcast directory and network.

= What is a Mega-feed? =

Recast PRO has a killer feature called the Mega-feed. Instead of requiring listeners to subscribe individually to each podcast in your network, your network itself is a feed. Listeners simply subscribe to the mega-feed and then will begin receiving all epsiode content from all podcasters in your network.

The mega-feed is a fantastic way to encourage listener and podcaster loyalty as well as promoting new podcasts without a large listener audience.

= Are you available for customizations or custom WordPress programming? =

Yes, developing custom WordPress applications is my full-time occupation and has been for the last 15 years. Please contact ben at benallfree.com
